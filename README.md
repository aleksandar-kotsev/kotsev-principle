# ðŸ§  The Kotsev Principle

> **"The amount of well-written code leads to qualitative constraints in future development."**  
> â€“ Aleksandar Kotsev

## ðŸ’¡ The Idea

As a codebase reaches a high level of quality, stability, and coverage, it begins to impose **restrictions on change**.  
This is not a flaw â€” it's a natural consequence of good structure.

Developers face a familiar dilemma:  
ðŸ”§ *Do we modify the stable core?*  
ðŸ§© *Or build around it with compromises?*

## ðŸ§­ When It Applies

- In library and API design
- In mature or legacy systems with high stability
- In software with strict backward compatibility
- In open-source projects with many users

## ðŸ“Œ Implications

- Every new idea must be **evaluated in the context of the existing structure**
- High-quality code doesn't grant freedom â€” it **demands responsibility**
- Change becomes a **strategic decision**, not just a technical one
